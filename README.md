# perl-weekly-challenges

Trying to solve Perl Weekly challenges mentioned in <url>https://perlweeklychallenge.org/challenges/</url> website.
Collection of solutions to perl-weekly challenges.

Challenge 001 - 
1. Write a script to replace the character ‘e’ with ‘E’ in the string ‘Perl Weekly Challenge’. Also print the number of times the character ‘e’ is found in the string.
2. Write a one-liner to solve the FizzBuzz problem and print the numbers 1 through 20. However, any number divisible by 3 should be replaced by the word ‘fizz’ and any divisible by 5 by the word ‘buzz’. Those numbers that are both divisible by 3 and 5 become ‘fizzbuzz’.

Challenge 002 - 
1. Write a script or one-liner to remove leading zeros from positive numbers.
2. Write a script that can convert integers to and from a base35 representation, using the characters 0-9 and A-Y. Dave Jacoby came up with nice description about base35, in case you needed some background.
